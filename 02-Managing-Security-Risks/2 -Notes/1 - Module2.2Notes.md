The relationship between frameworks and controls
-------------------------------------------------


### üìö Key Vocabulary

- **Security Frameworks**: Guidelines for building plans to mitigate risks and threats. They help organizations comply with laws and regulations.
- **Security Controls**: Safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. These are the actions taken to lower risks.

### üèõÔ∏è Examples of Frameworks

- **NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)**: Helps organizations understand and manage cybersecurity risks.
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**: Provides a common language for managing cybersecurity risks.
- **Cyber Threat Framework (CTF)**: Developed by the U.S. government to provide a common language for describing cyberthreat activity.
- **ISO/IEC 27001**: Internationally recognized framework for managing information security, outlining requirements, best practices, and controls.

### üõ°Ô∏è Examples of Controls

- **Physical Controls**: Gates, locks, security guards, CCTV.
- **Technical Controls**: Firewalls, multi-factor authentication (MFA), antivirus software.
- **Administrative Controls**: Separation of duties, authorization processes, asset classification.

### ‚úÖ Key Takeaways

- **Frameworks and controls work together** to establish an organization's security posture.
- They help organizations **meet security goals and comply with regulations**.
- While often voluntary, **implementing frameworks and controls is strongly encouraged** to protect critical assets.

# Use the CIA Triad to Protect Organization Material

## Key Vocabulary

* **CIA Triad:** A model that guides organizations in mitigating risk, encompassing **Confidentiality**, **Integrity**, and **Availability**.
* **Confidentiality:**  Ensuring only authorized users can access specific data or assets.
* **Integrity:**  Guaranteeing data is accurate, trustworthy, and tamper-proof.
* **Availability:** Ensuring authorized users have timely and reliable access to data and systems.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:**  A security principle that limits user access to only the information necessary for their tasks.
* **Cryptography:** Techniques used to secure data and communication, often to prevent unauthorized access or modification.
* **Encryption:**  The process of converting data into an unreadable format, making it inaccessible without proper decryption.
* **Security Posture:** An organization's overall cybersecurity strength and ability to handle threats.

## Key Takeaways

* The CIA triad is a fundamental framework for building a strong security posture within an organization.
* **Confidentiality** is maintained through access controls and the principle of least privilege.
* **Integrity** is ensured through measures like cryptography and encryption, guaranteeing data authenticity.
* **Availability** focuses on providing reliable access to data and systems for authorized users.
* Cybersecurity analysts use the CIA triad to guide their decisions and actions in protecting organizational assets.
-------------------------------------------------
# NIST CSF Core Functions

The NIST CSF (National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework) outlines five core functions to guide organizations in managing cybersecurity risks.

## 1. **Identify**

* **Definition:** Develop an understanding of your organization's cybersecurity risks in relation to its people, assets, data, and capabilities.
* **Key Vocabulary:** Risk assessment, asset inventory, threat modeling, vulnerability scanning.
* **Key Takeaway:**  Before you can protect your organization, you need to know what you're protecting and what you're protecting it from.

## 2. **Protect**

* **Definition:** Implement safeguards to ensure the delivery of critical services. This includes developing and implementing appropriate safeguards to ensure the delivery of critical infrastructure services.
* **Key Vocabulary:**  Access control, data security, awareness training, vulnerability management, security plan.
* **Key Takeaway:**  Establish preventative measures to mitigate potential threats and vulnerabilities.

## 3. **Detect**

* **Definition:**  Identify cybersecurity events when they occur.
* **Key Vocabulary:** Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), Intrusion Detection System (IDS), Security Operations Center (SOC), log analysis.
* **Key Takeaway:**  Have systems in place to quickly identify when a security event is happening so you can take appropriate action.

## 4. **Respond**

* **Definition:**  Take action to contain and mitigate the impact of a cybersecurity incident.
* **Key Vocabulary:** Incident Response Plan, containment strategies, eradication, recovery, lessons learned.
* **Key Takeaway:**  Don't just identify an incident - have a plan to contain it and minimize its impact.

## 5. **Recover**

* **Definition:** Restore any capabilities or services that were impaired due to a cybersecurity incident.
* **Key Vocabulary:**  Data recovery, system restoration, business continuity, disaster recovery.
* **Key Takeaway:**  Have a plan to get back to business as usual as quickly and efficiently as possible after an incident.
-------------------------------------------------
OWASP security principles

*   **Establish secure defaults:** An application's default state should be its most secure state.
*   **Fail securely:** When a control fails, it should default to the most secure option.
*   **Don't trust services:** Don't automatically trust the security of third-party systems, even those of partners.
*   **Avoid security by obscurity:** System security shouldn't rely on hiding information but on robust security measures.

The reading emphasizes that applying these and previously learned OWASP principles helps cybersecurity professionals protect organizations and users.

## Security Audits: A Summary

This reading focuses on **security audits**, which are independent reviews checking if an organization's security controls, policies, and procedures meet internal and external standards.

Here are some key takeaways:

*   **Goals:** Ensure IT practices meet standards and identify areas for improvement.
*   **Objectives:** Find and fix security gaps, providing guidance for a stronger security posture.
*   **Factors influencing audits:**
    * Industry
    * Size
    * Regulations
    * Location
    * Compliance choices
*   **Frameworks and controls:**
    * NIST CSF and ISO 27000 help prepare for audits and ensure compliance.
*   **Audit checklist:**
    * Defines scope
    * Goals
    * Risk assessment
    * Procedures
    * Reporting

The reading emphasizes the importance of security audits in maintaining a strong security posture and meeting compliance requirements
