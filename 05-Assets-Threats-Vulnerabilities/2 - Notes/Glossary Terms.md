# Module 2 Glossary of Terms

This glossary defines key cybersecurity terms from Module 2.

## Access Control & Authentication

- **Access controls:** Security controls that manage access, authorization, and accountability of information.
- **Authentication:** The process of verifying the identity of a user or device.
- **Authorization:** Granting or denying access to resources based on verified identity.
- **Basic auth:** The technology used to establish a user’s request to access a server.
- **Multi-factor authentication (MFA):** A security measure that requires a user to verify their identity in two or more ways to access a system or network.
- **Session:** A sequence of network HTTP basic auth requests and responses associated with the same user.
- **Session cookie:** A token that websites use to validate a session and determine how long that session should last.
- **Session hijacking:** An event when attackers obtain a legitimate user’s session ID.
- **Session ID:** A unique token that identifies a user and their device while accessing a system.
- **Single Sign-On (SSO):** A technology that combines several different logins into one.

## Cryptography

- **Algorithm:** A set of rules used to solve a problem.
- **Asymmetric encryption:** The use of a public and private key pair for encryption and decryption of data.
- **Cipher:** An algorithm that encrypts information.
- **Cryptographic key:** A mechanism that decrypts ciphertext.
- **Cryptography:** The process of transforming information into a form that unintended readers can’t understand.
- **Decryption:** The process of converting data from an encoded format back to a readable format.
- **Encryption:** The process of converting data from a readable format to an encoded format.
- **Hash collision:** An instance when different inputs produce the same hash value.
- **Hash function:** An algorithm that produces a code that can’t be decrypted.
- **Hash table:** A data structure that's used to store and reference hash values.
- **Public key infrastructure (PKI):** An encryption framework that secures the exchange of online information.
- **Rainbow table:** A file of pre-generated hash values and their associated plaintext.
- **Salting:** An additional safeguard that’s used to strengthen hash functions.
- **Symmetric encryption:** The use of a single secret key to exchange information.

## Data Security

- **Application programming interface (API) token:** A small block of encrypted code that contains information about a user.
- **Bit:** The smallest unit of data measurement on a computer.
- **Brute force attack:** The trial and error process of discovering private information.
- **Data custodian:** Anyone or anything that’s responsible for the safe handling, transport, and storage of information.
- **Data owner:** The person that decides who can access, edit, use, or destroy their information.
- **Digital certificate:** A file that verifies the identity of a public key holder.
- **Identity and access management (IAM):** A collection of processes and technologies that helps organizations manage digital identities in their environment.
- **Information privacy:** The protection of unauthorized access and distribution of data.
- **Non-repudiation:** The concept that the authenticity of information can’t be denied.
- **OAuth:** An open-standard authorization protocol that shares designated access between applications.
- **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS):** A set of security standards formed by major organizations in the financial industry.
- **Personally identifiable information (PII):** Any information used to infer an individual's identity.
- **Principle of least privilege:** The concept of granting only the minimal access and authorization required to complete a task or function.
- **Protected health information (PHI):** Information that relates to the past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition of an individual.
- **Security assessment:** A check to determine how resilient current security implementations are against threats.
- **Security audit:** A review of an organization's security controls, policies, and procedures against a set of expectations.
- **Security controls:** Safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks.
- **Separation of duties:** The principle that users should not be given levels of authorization that would allow them to misuse a system.
- **User provisioning:** The process of creating and maintaining a user's digital identity.
