## Understanding Risk, Threats, and Vulnerabilities in Cybersecurity

This document summarizes the key concepts of risk, threats, and vulnerabilities in a cybersecurity context.

### Defining Key Terms

- **Risk:** Anything that can potentially harm the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset. The level of risk is determined by the likelihood of an event occurring and its potential impact.
- **Threat:** A circumstance or event that has the potential to negatively impact assets. Threats can be intentional (e.g., a malicious hacker) or unintentional (e.g., an employee's mistake).
- **Vulnerability:** A weakness that a threat could exploit. Vulnerabilities can be technical (e.g., software flaw) or human-related (e.g., negligence).

### Risk Factors and Their Relationship

- The likelihood of an asset being compromised depends on threats exploiting existing vulnerabilities.
- Security professionals focus on reducing the likelihood of risks by addressing these factors.
- Understanding the relationship between risks, threats, and vulnerabilities is crucial for building a strong foundation in cybersecurity.

# Asset Management and Classification

## Asset Management Importance

- Asset management focuses on tracking assets and their risks to ensure effective protection. This requires a clear understanding of the assets an organization possesses.
- Organizations need to protect a range of assets, including:
  - **Digital Assets:** Customer data, financial records, etc.
  - **Information Systems:** Networks, software, etc.
  - **Physical Assets:** Facilities, equipment, supplies, etc.
  - **Intangible Assets:** Brand reputation, intellectual property, etc.

## Asset Classification and its Benefits

- **Asset classification** is the practice of categorizing assets based on their sensitivity and importance to the organization.
- Benefits of asset classification:
  - Enables effective risk management strategies.
  - Helps prioritize security resources.
  - Can reduce IT costs.
  - Supports compliance with legal regulations.

## Common Asset Classification Levels

- A common classification scheme uses these levels:

  - **Restricted:** Highest level for extremely sensitive assets (e.g., need-to-know information).
  - **Confidential:** Assets whose disclosure could have a significant negative impact on the organization.
  - **Internal-Only:** Assets accessible to employees and business partners.
  - **Public:** Lowest level; assets with minimal consequences if publicly released.

  ## Cloud Computing: Balancing Benefits and Security Risks

This document summarizes the cybersecurity challenges and opportunities presented by the transition to cloud-based services.

### Benefits of Cloud Services

- **Simplified Operations:** Cloud technologies streamline online business operations, enabling companies to scale and adapt rapidly while minimizing costs.
- **Versatile Solutions:** Cloud-based services offer a wide array of solutions, ranging from website hosting to comprehensive back-end infrastructure, catering to diverse business requirements.

### Cloud Security Concerns

- **Shared Responsibility:** The shared responsibility model in cloud security requires a clear understanding of security obligations between cloud service providers and their clients.
- **Misconfiguration Risks:** Misconfiguration of cloud services is a significant concern, often stemming from the use of default settings that fail to address specific security needs.
- **Compliance Challenges:** Monitoring access and meeting regulatory standards such as HIPAA or GDPR can be complex in cloud environments.

# NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) Summary

## Origins and Benefits

- Developed by NIST to safeguard critical U.S. infrastructure and later adapted for public and private sectors.
- Highly flexible and adaptable, making it suitable for organizations of all sizes and across various industries.

## Components

### The Core

- Outlines desired cybersecurity outcomes through six key functions:
  - **Identify:** Understand and manage cybersecurity risks to systems, assets, data, and capabilities.
  - **Protect:** Develop and implement appropriate safeguards to ensure the delivery of critical infrastructure services.
  - **Detect:** Define, implement, and manage activities to identify the occurrence of a cybersecurity event.
  - **Respond:** Develop and implement appropriate activities to take action regarding a detected cybersecurity event.
  - **Recover:** Develop and implement appropriate activities to maintain plans for resilience and restore any capabilities or services impaired due to a cybersecurity event.
  - **Govern:** Develop and implement the activities that support the governance of an organization's cybersecurity risk management practices.

### Tiers

- Provide a mechanism for organizations to view and understand the characteristics of their cybersecurity risk management programs.
- Range from Tier 1 (Partial) to Tier 4 (Adaptive), reflecting the increasing sophistication and proactive nature of an organization's cybersecurity posture.

### Profiles

- Offer pre-defined templates aligned with specific industry sectors or organizational needs.
- Help organizations establish a baseline for their cybersecurity programs and facilitate comparisons with established standards.

## Implementation

- Organizations are encouraged to:

  - Create a comprehensive profile of their current security operations.
  - Conduct a thorough risk assessment to identify areas where existing operations align with business objectives and regulatory requirements.
  - Analyze and prioritize security gaps that expose the organization to potential risks.
  - Develop and execute a detailed plan of action to address identified gaps and achieve cybersecurity goals.

- The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) offers valuable resources and guidance on effective CSF implementation.
