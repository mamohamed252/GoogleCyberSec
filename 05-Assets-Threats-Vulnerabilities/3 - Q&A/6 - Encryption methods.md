### Which of the following elements are required when using encryption? Select all that apply.

- Cipher.
- Key
- Hint\* A cipher and a key are required when using encryption. This enables secure information exchange.

### Which technologies are used in public key infrastructure (PKI) to securely exchange information online? Select two answers.

- Encryption algorithms.
- Digital certificates.
- Hint\* PKI uses encryption algorithms and digital certificates to securely exchange information online. Asymmetric and symmetric algorithms are used first to quickly and securely encrypt data. Digital certificates are used second as a way of signaling trust between the sender and receiver when exchanging encrypted data online.

### Fill in the blank: **\_** encryption produces a public and private key pair.

- Asymmetric.
- Hint\* Asymmetric encryption produces a public and private key pair that are used to encrypt and decrypt information. The public key is shared with others while the data owner manages the private key.

### An attacker gains access to a database where user passwords are secured with the SHA-256 hashing algorithm. Can the attacker decrypt the user passwords?

- No. Hash algorithms do not produce decryption keys.
- Hint\* The attacker cannot decrypt the user passwords because they are stored as a hash value that is irreversible. Only symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms produce decryption keys.

### What term describes being unable to deny that information is authentic?

- Non-repudiation.
- Hint\* Non-repudiation means that the authenticity of information can't be denied. It also confirms that the sender of data is who they claim to be. Integrity means that the data is correct, authentic, and reliable. It is one aspect of non-repudiation.
