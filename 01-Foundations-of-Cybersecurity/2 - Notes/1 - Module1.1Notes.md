# Week 1: Introduction to Cybersecurity

## Introduction to Cybersecurity

**Cybersecurity (or security)** – Ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information by protecting networks, devices, people, and data from unauthorized access or criminal exploitation.

**Example:** Use of complex passwords

**Threat Actor** – Any person or group who presents a security risk

---

## Benefits of Security

- Protects against internal and external threats
  - **Internal** – Comes from current or past employees, external vendors, trusted partners. Could even be someone clicking on a risky link.
  - **External** – Someone outside the organization trying to gain access to private information, networks, or devices.
- Meets regulatory compliance
- Maintains and improves business productivity
- Reduces expenses
- Maintains brand trust
  *If services or customer data are compromised, this can reduce trust or even revenue.*

## Primary Jobs of a Security Analyst

- Protecting computer and network systems
- Installing prevention software
- Conducting periodic security audits
- Ensuring computer passwords are not accessible to all employees

### Two Parts of the Job

1. **Operations** – Responding to detections and doing investigations (Security Analyst role)
2. **Projects** – Working with other teams to build or improve detections (Engineer role, but can also involve operations)

## Key Cybersecurity Terms and Concepts

- **Compliance**: Adhering to internal standards and external regulations to avoid fines and breaches.
- **Security Frameworks**: Guidelines used to build plans for mitigating data and privacy risks.
- **Security Controls**: Safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks.
- **Security Posture**: An organization’s ability to manage its defenses and respond to changes.

- **Threat Actor**: Any person or group who poses a security risk (computers, networks, data, etc.).
- **Internal Threat**: A risk posed by insiders, sometimes accidental (e.g., clicking a malicious link) or intentional (e.g., unauthorized access).
- **Network Security**: Keeping an organization's network infrastructure secure from unauthorized access.
- **Cloud Security**: Ensuring cloud-stored assets are configured correctly and only accessible by authorized users.

- **Programming**: Creating specific sets of instructions for a computer to:
  - Automate repetitive tasks (e.g., checking a list of malicious domains)
  - Review web traffic
  - Alert for suspicious activity

## Core Skills for Cybersecurity Professionals

- **Programming Languages**
- **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) Tools**
  *Collect and analyze log data (e.g., login behavior) to help identify threats and vulnerabilities.*
- **Computer Forensics**

### Technical Skills

- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs)** – Used to monitor system activity and alert on possible intrusions.

---

## Data Protection: PII & SPII

- **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)** – Any information used to infer an individual’s identity
  *Examples: Full name, DOB, email, address, IP address*

- **Sensitive PII (SPII)** – Specific type of PII under stricter handling
  *Examples: SSN, medical, or financial info*

---

## Security Analyst Responsibilities

- Conduct scans and monitor IDSs for potential threats
- Ensure security systems are functioning and up-to-date
- Test systems to verify threat detection
- Inform others of findings and educate on protection measures

> *"The most exciting part of my day is protecting and securing data that is important to people. It makes me feel important."*
