# Week 3: Foundations of Cybersecurity

## Role of the Analyst

As an analyst, I will start by identifying my organization’s critical assets and risks, then I will implement the necessary frameworks and controls.

---

## Security Frameworks

**Definition:** Guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy.

**Purpose:**
- Protecting PII
- Securing financial information
- Identifying security weaknesses
- Aligning security with business goals

### Four Core Components:
1. Identifying and documenting security goals
2. Setting guidelines to achieve security goals
3. Implementing strong security processes
4. Monitoring and communicating results

Frameworks enable collaboration across security teams and help document standard procedures — essential for entry-level analysts.

---

## Security Controls

**Definition:** Safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks.

---

## Secure Design: The CIA Triad

The CIA Triad is a foundational model that informs risk considerations when establishing systems and security policies.

- **Confidentiality:** Only authorized users can access specific data.
- **Integrity:** Data is correct, authentic, and reliable.
  - *Safeguard:* Encryption to prevent tampering.
- **Availability:** Data is accessible to those who are authorized.

**Asset:** An item with value to an organization (e.g., servers storing PII like SSNs or driver's licenses).

---

## NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

A voluntary framework developed by the **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)** with standards, guidelines, and best practices for managing cybersecurity risk.

---

## Notable Controls, Frameworks, and Compliance Programs

- **NIST (CSF, RMF)** – U.S. based, globally recognized
- **FERC-NERC** – Related to U.S. electricity and power grid regulation
- **FedRAMP®** – Standardizes cloud security assessment for U.S. government use
- **CIS® (Center for Internet Security)** – Helps organizations build defense plans
- **GDPR (EU)** – Protects data privacy for EU residents
- **PCI DSS** – Manages security for credit card data and reduces fraud
- **HIPAA** – U.S. law protecting patient health information
- **ISO** – Sets international standards for various sectors
- **SOC 1 & SOC 2** – Assess organizational controls around data access and integrity

---

## HIPAA & HITRUST

- **HIPAA** covers privacy, security, and breach notification rules.
- **HITRUST®** is a framework to help organizations comply with HIPAA.

---

## Ethical Principles in Security

**Security Ethics:** Guidelines for making appropriate decisions as a security professional.

---

## Counterattacks

### U.S. Standpoint
- **Illegal** due to laws like the **Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (1986)** and the **Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (2015)**.
- Only federal employees and military personnel can lawfully counterattack.

### International Standpoint
- Guided by the **International Court of Justice (ICJ)**.
- Counterattack is only lawful if:
  1. It targets the original attacker.
  2. It's a direct communication requesting the attack stop.
  3. It doesn’t escalate the situation.
  4. It can be reversed.

**Note:** Most organizations avoid counterattacks due to legal and ethical risks.

---

## Confidentiality & Privacy Protections

- **Confidentiality:** Only authorized users can access data; respect for privacy is crucial.
- **Privacy Protection:** Safeguarding PII/SPII from unauthorized use.

---

## Legal Definitions

- **Laws:** Recognized rules enforced by a governing body.
