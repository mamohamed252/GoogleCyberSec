# Foundations of Cybersecurity – Course 1, Week 4

## Important Cybersecurity Tools

### What You’ll Learn
- SIEM Tools
- Playbooks
- Network Protocol Analyzers
- Linux Operating System
- Programming Languages: SQL and Python

---

## Logs

**Log** – A record of events that occur within an organization’s systems
Examples:
- Signing into a computer
- Accessing web-based services
Logs help identify vulnerabilities and potential security breaches.

---

## SIEM Tools (Security Information and Event Management)

**Definition:** An application that collects and analyzes log data to monitor critical activities.

**Purpose:**
- Reduces data an analyst has to review by providing alerts
- Detects specific types of risks and threats

### Common SIEM Tools:
- **Splunk** – Self-hosted platform to search and analyze log data.
- **Google Chronicle** – Cloud-native SIEM tool for fast feature delivery.

Both tools collect data from multiple sources, filter and analyze it to help security teams detect and respond to threats efficiently.

### SIEM Capabilities:
- Provide visual dashboards for data analysis
- Available in **on-premise** and **cloud-hosted** formats
- Used for incident analysis and proactive threat hunting

---

## Other Key Security Tools

### Playbooks

**Definition:** Manuals providing step-by-step guidance for handling security incidents.
They help before, during, and after incidents occur.

#### Types of Playbooks:
1. **Chain of Custody**
   Tracks evidence handling throughout the incident lifecycle.
2. **Protecting and Preserving Evidence**
   Focuses on volatile digital evidence and prioritizing data capture based on the *order of volatility*.
   - Volatile data should be preserved first.
   - Use copies of data for investigation to preserve original integrity.

### Network Protocol Analyzer (Packet Sniffer)

**Definition:** A tool to capture and analyze network traffic.
**Examples:** TCP Dump, Wireshark

---

## Core Cybersecurity Knowledge and Skills

### Programming
Used to automate tasks with high accuracy and efficiency.

### Linux
- Open-source OS with a command-line interface
- Commonly used for log analysis
- Allows use of text-based commands

### SQL (Structured Query Language)
Used to:
- Create and interact with databases
- Filter and retrieve specific information from large data collections

### Python
Automates repetitive, time-consuming tasks requiring precision.

---

## Operating Systems

An interface between computer hardware and the user.
**Examples:** Linux, macOS, Windows

---

## Additional Security Tools

### Antivirus Software (Anti-Malware)
- Detects and removes malware
- Scans memory for malicious patterns

### Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
- Monitors activity and alerts on intrusions
- Analyzes packets of network data

### Encryption
- Converts readable (plaintext) data into **ciphertext**
- Ensures confidentiality of data

**Note:**
- **Cryptographic Coding** – Converts plaintext to ciphertext
- **Encoding** – Public method used to convert data formats between systems

---

### Penetration Testing (Pen Testing)
Simulated cyberattack to identify system vulnerabilities.
