# Week 2 Course 1 – The Evolution of Cybersecurity

## Malware and Computer Viruses

- **Computer Virus** – Malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software.
- **Malware** – Software designed to harm devices or networks.

### Types of Malware

- **Viruses**: Malicious code that requires user action to activate and spreads by hiding in files.
- **Worms**: Self-replicating malware that spreads without user interaction.
- **Ransomware**: Encrypts data and demands payment for restoration.
- **Spyware**: Gathers and sells private data without consent.

---

## Social Engineering

**Definition**: A manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables.

### Common Types

- **Social media phishing**
- **Watering hole attack**
- **USB baiting**
- **Physical social engineering**

### Principles Behind Social Engineering

- **Authority**: Impersonating people in power.
- **Intimidation**: Using bullying tactics.
- **Consensus/Social proof**: "Others trust me, so you should too."
- **Scarcity**: Creating urgency through limited availability.
- **Familiarity**: Establishing fake emotional connections.
- **Trust**: Gaining personal info through ongoing relationships.
- **Urgency**: Pressuring victims to act quickly.

## Phishing

**Definition**: Use of digital communication to deceive users into revealing information or installing malware.

### Types of Phishing

- **Business Email Compromise (BEC)**
- **Spear phishing**
- **Whaling**
- **Vishing** – Voice calls
- **Smishing** – Text messages

## The Eight CISSP Security Domains

1. **Security and Risk Management**

   - Risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, laws.
   - _e.g., Updating HIPAA policies._

2. **Asset Security**

   - Protection and disposal of digital and physical assets.
   - _e.g., Securely destroying equipment with sensitive data._

3. **Security Architecture and Engineering**

   - Using tools/systems to optimize data security.
   - _e.g., Configuring firewalls._

4. **Communication and Network Security**

   - Managing physical and wireless network security.
   - _e.g., Creating network policies, analyzing behavior._

5. **Identity and Access Management**

   - Managing access to physical and digital resources.

6. **Security Assessment and Testing**

   - Security audits and permission reviews.
   - _e.g., Payroll access audit._

7. **Security Operations**

   - Investigations and implementing preventative measures.
   - _e.g., Responding to unknown network devices._

8. **Software Development Security**
   - Secure coding practices in the development lifecycle.
   - _e.g., Password policy reviews in app development._

## Attack Types and Their Domains

- **Password Attack** (e.g., Brute Force, Rainbow Table)
  → _Communication and Network Security_

- **Social Engineering Attack** (e.g., phishing, USB baiting)
  → _Security and Risk Management_

- **Physical Attack** (e.g., malicious USB, card skimming)
  → _Asset Security_

- **AI Attacks** (e.g., ML manipulation)
  → _Communication/Network Security, Identity/Access Management_

- **Supply Chain Attacks**
  → _Various domains: Security Ops, Engineering, Risk Management_

- **Cryptographic Attack** (e.g., Birthday, Collision)
  → _Communication and Network Security_

## Understanding Attackers

### Threat Actor

Any person or group who poses a security risk.

### Types of Threat Actors

- **Advanced Persistent Threats (APT)**

  - Skilled, stealthy attackers targeting infrastructure or IP.

- **Insider Threats**

  - Individuals with authorized access who act maliciously.

- **Hacktivists**
  - Politically motivated threat actors using cyber tactics.

---

## Hacker Types

- **Authorized Hackers / Ethical Hackers** – Follow laws and assist organizations.
- **Semi-Authorized Hackers / Researchers** – Seek vulnerabilities without exploiting them.
- **Unauthorized Hackers** – Unethical individuals breaking the law for personal gain.
