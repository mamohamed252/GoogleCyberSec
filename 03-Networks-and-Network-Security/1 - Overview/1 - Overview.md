In this section of the course, learners will familiarize themselves with network hardening practices that strengthen network systems over time. Security professionals work against experiencing numerous security breaches, which is why it is important to take preliminary security measures to remain one step ahead of attackers. Malicious actors are constantly evolving in their intrusion methods and network security hardening is a defensive strategy that aims to prevent or lessen the chances of future attacks taking place. Security hardening also involves securing applications over cloud systems and addressing the unique security challenges posed by cloud infrastructures.

Learning Objectives

- Describe OS hardening techniques
- Describe network and cloud hardening techniques that target network vulnerabilities
- Describe network hardening techniques
- Explain cloud security practices
