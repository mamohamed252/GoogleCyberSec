### What type of information is contained within the header of an IP packet?

- The sender’s IP address, the destination's MAC address, and the protocol to use

- Hint\* The sender’s IP address, the destination's MAC address, and the protocol to use.

### What characteristics do the TCP/IP and OSI models share? Select all that apply.

- Both models illustrate network processes and protocols for data transmission between two or more systems.

- Correct
- Both the TCP/IP and OSI models illustrate network processes and protocols for data transmission between two or more systems.

- Both models define standards for networking and divide the network communication process into different layers.

- Correct
- Both the TCP/IP and OSI models define standards for networking and divide the network communication process into different layers.

- Correct
- Both the TCP/IP and OSI models include an application and a transport layer..

### What is the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)?

- internet communication convention.
- Hint\* The TCP is an internet communication convention, or protocol. It allows two devices to form a connection and stream data.

### Fill in the blank: A **\_** is a software-based location that organizes the sending and receiving of data between devices on a network.

- port.
- Hint\* A network channel is the medium through which a wireless internet network sends and receives data. A port is a software-based location that organizes the sending and receiving of data between devices on a network.

### Which layer of the TCP/IP model has protocols that organize file transfers and email services?

- application layer.
- Hint\* The application layer has protocols that organize file transfers and email services. It does this by determining how data packets will interact with receiving devices. The application layer is the fourth layer in the TCP/IP model.
