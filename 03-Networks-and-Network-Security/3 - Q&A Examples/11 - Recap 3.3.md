### What do network-level Denial of Service (DoS) attacks target?

- Network bandwidth

- Hint\*

### Which of the following statements accurately describe Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks? Select three answers.

- In both DoS and DDoS attacks, if any part of the network is overloaded, the attacks are successful.

- A DoS attack targets a network or server.

- A DDoS attack may use multiple devices in different locations to flood the target network with unwanted traffic.

- Hint\*

### A security team discovers that an attacker has taken advantage of the handshake process that is used to establish a TCP connection between a device and their server. Which DoS attack does this scenario describe?

- SYN flood attack

- Hint\*

### Fill in the blank: The maximum size of a correctly formatted IPv4 ICMP packet is **\_**, as opposed to the oversized packet that is sent during a Ping of Death attack.

- 64KB.
- Hint\*

### Which of the following statements correctly describe passive and active packet sniffing? Select three answers.

- Passive packet sniffing allows malicious actors to view the information going in and out of the targeted device.

- Using a VPN to encrypt data offers a business protection from packet sniffing.

- Active packet sniffing involves data packets being manipulated in transit.

- Hint\*

### As a security professional, you implement safeguards against attackers changing the source IP of a data packet in order to communicate over your company’s network. What type of network attack are you trying to avoid?

- IP spoofing.
- Hint\*

### Fill in the blank: **\_** is a network attack performed when an attacker changes the source IP of a data packet to impersonate an authorized system and gain access to a network.

- IP spoofing.
- Hint\*

### In which attack would malicious actors gain access to a network, put themselves between a web browser and a web server, then sniff the packet to learn the devices’ IP and MAC addresses?

- On-path attack.
- Hint\*

### Fill in the blank: The **\_** network attack occurs when a malicious actor takes a network transmission that was sent by an authorized user and repeats it at a later time to impersonate that user.

- replay.
- Hint\*

### Which attack is a combination of a DDoS and an IP spoofing attack, during which the malicious actor overwhelms a target computer?

- Smurf attack.
- Hint\*
